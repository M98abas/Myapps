# env-cmd
A simple node program for executing commands using an environment from an env file.

## Install
`npm install env-cmd`

## Usage
**Environment file `./test/.env`**
```
# This is a comment
ENV1=THANKS # Yay inline comments support
ENV2=FOR ALL
ENV3 THE FISH # This format is also accepted

# Surround value in double quotes when using a # symbol in the value
ENV4="ValueContains#Symbol"

# If using double quotes as part of the value, you must surround the value in double quotes
ENV5=""Value includes double quotes""
```

**Package.json**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "env-cmd ./test/.env mocha -R spec"
  }
}
```
or

**Terminal**
```sh
./node_modules/.bin/env-cmd ./test/.env node index.js
```
or

**.env-cmdrc file `.env-cmdrc`**

```json
{
  "development": {
    "ENV1": "Thanks",
    "ENV2": "For All"
  },
  "production": {
    "ENV1": "The Fish"
  }
}
```

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/env-cmd production node index.js
```

## Environment File Formats

These are the currently accepted environment file formats. If any other formats are desired please create an issue.
- `key=value`
- `key value`
- Key/value pairs as JSON
- JavaScript file exporting an object
- `.env-cmdrc` file (as valid json) in execution directory

## Why

Because sometimes its just too cumbersome passing lots of environment variables to scripts. Its usually just easier to have a file with all the vars in them, especially for development and testing.

**Do not commit sensitive environment data to a public git repo!**
